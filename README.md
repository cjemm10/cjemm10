Hello! I am Chris Emm, and this is my github page!
I am a computer science student at the University of Maryland, and I have interests in both data science and cybersecurity.
On my page you will see a directory called cmsc320, which is the Introductoy Data Science course at UMD.
    This directory will have all of the projects that we were tasked with completing throughout the semester.
